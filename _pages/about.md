I'm a third-year Ph.D. student in the College of Computer Science and Technology at the National University of Defense Technology (NUDT), China. My research interests lie in **computer architecture**, **deep learning acceleration**, and **efficient machine learning systems**.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Mei Wen](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mei-Wen-3) at the MASA Lab. My research focuses on designing **sparsity-aware DNN accelerators**, **robust pruning techniques**, and **hardware-software co-design** strategies for efficient AI systems.

I have published several papers in EDA and architecture conferences such as **DATE**, **ICCAD**, and **ICPP**. Representative works include:

- **SparSynergy** (DATE 2025): A framework for unified sparsity format and synergistic model-hardware co-optimization.
- **STEM & STEMA** (ICCAD 2025): A robust structured pruning mechanism and corresponding accelerator for vision Transformers.
- **SmartBlock** (ICPP 2025): An adaptive block floating-point quantization approach for efficient DNN acceleration.

I'm always passionate about bridging the gap between **ML algorithms** and **hardware design**, and open to academic discussions and collaborations.
